                        <h2>What is it?</h2>
                        <p>WhiteCat is both an open hardware platform and a blocks-based graphical programming language.</p>
                        <div class="centered">

                        <p>It is white as in an empty canvas, ready for you to build whatever you can imagine.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h3>What's new about it?</h3>
                        <h4>No compiling, real-time automagic deployment</h4>
                        <p>The WhiteCat board can be programmed in a live, dynamic, blocks-based language. Not just interfaced, but really programmed. It works just as you expect it to.</p> 
                        <p>WhiteCat programs are automagically deployed in real time to the board, meaning you can just unplug it at anytime. No compilation, no file transferring. Just unplug the board and whatever was running in the blocks environment will keep running in the board.</p>
                        <div class="centered">
                            <img class="rounded bordered v-spaced" src="img/unplug.gif">
                        </div>
                        <h4>Built to be connected</h4>
                        <p>The whole system was designed from the beginning to be able to be deployed in a distributed environment. Boards can communicate with each other -or with other devices- by means of standard protocols, such as the CANbus industry standard or the MQTT network messaging protocol.</p>
                        <p>These are all built-in in the language, and simple block abstractions let you weave a network of devices in the simplest possible way.</p>
                        <h4>Standard compliant</h4>
                        <p>The WhiteCat is the first PIC-based board that reimplements the whole system stack. Instead of the usual proprietary vendor-locked libraries, we have decided to stand by our principles and base our system in the standard, free -as in freedom and as in gratis- GCC libs.</p>
                        <p>Everything in the system strives to adhere to standards, which is why we include hardware and software abstractions for the CANbus, MQTT and REST protocols, allowing the board to be seamlessly integrated in any other environment and communicate with any standard-compliant device.</p>
                        <h4>You can build it yourself</h4>
                        <p>The WhiteCat board is so much open hardware that you can actually build it yourself at home! We not only provide the factory-grade schematics, but also provide plans and a detailed process description for you to etch the circuits and solder the board by yourself.</p>
                        <p>As a single-faced board, the home-brewed version is larger than the factory made one, but it packs pretty much the same capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Have you ever imagined being able to hand-solder a 32 bit, 200 MHz computer that you can hold in your hand and is powerful enough to even run LiteBSD 4.4?</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Why develop a whole new system?</h3>
                        <p>There are several static blocks systems for different hardware solutions that just translate blocks to text. While these help overcome initial barriers to learning programming, they are not live, dynamic environments and the languages they translate to are very low level and lack fundamental computationally rich features, like first class heterogeneous lists, higher order functions or an event system.</p>
                        <p>To overcome this gap, the <a href="http://edutec.citilab.eu" target="_blank">Edutec</a> team built <a href="http://s4a.cat/snap">Snap4Arduino</a>, which is based on the <a target="_blank" href="http://snap.berkeley.edu">Snap<i>!</i></a> programming language and thus inherits all features that we believe an educational, powerful language should have, but on the other hand it lacks the possibility of making the board autonomous.</p>
                        <p>The WhiteCat blocks environment is conceived to address both needs: having a dynamic, real-time, high-level, blocks-based visual language and, at the same time, allowing you to build an autonomous hardware system while removing the need to compile or translate anything. With the WhiteCat system, the lines between prototype and final product become blurred. The environment lets you build your solutions in an experimental, real-time, iterative way without the need of any additional deployment process.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                        <p>The WhiteCat is targeted both at professionals, hobbyists and students, and is fitted for educational, industrial or domestic use indistinctly.</p>
                        <p>To achieve such wide range of applications and user bases, it packs a versatile programming stack meant to fit all profiles.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Blocks on top</h3>
                        <p>We believe programming should be for everyone, and not just for those who hold engineering or computer science degrees, which is why we have developed a blocks-based, dynamic environment based on a stripped-down version of <a target="_blank" href="http://snap.berkeley.edu">Snap<i>!</i></a>.</p>
                        <p>This visual programming environment maps directly to the board, which means all processes happen in the hardware, and the board will keep its state even after unplugging it from the computer and plugging it to a different power source. As in any other dynamic blocks-based language, you can run as many scripts in parallel as you want, and click on any block to run it while other processes are going on.</p>
                        <p>Since the language running in the board supports computationally rich features, the WhiteCat blocks environment allows you to program in an elegant and way, making use of heterogeneous lists, dictionaries<sup><a class="nostyle" href="#notyet">[*]</a></sup>, first class blocks<sup><a class="nostyle" href="#notyet">[*]</a></sup>, and higher order functions.</p>

                        <h3>Lua at the bottom</h3>
                        <p><a href="http://lua.org">Lua</a> is a widely used dynamic language that fits like a glove in the WhiteCat environment. <a href="http://lua.org">Lua</a> is small, fast, robust, embeddable and, most important, it maps beautifully to the dynamic, real-time block-based languages we love, like <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> and <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu">Snap<i>!</i></a>. Block scripts become coroutines, rings become anonymous functions, lists become tables.</p>
                        <p>Of course, if you are a <a href="http://lua.org">Lua</a> programmer, you can just plug yourself into the interpreter and start coding right away. The WhiteCat board includes the latest 5.3 version and you can find the library specifications in <a href="https://github.com/bromagosa/WhiteCat/wiki">our wiki</a>.</p>
